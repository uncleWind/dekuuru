# dekuuru
How to make a worse booru. And probably fail at it.

Quick insight at what a dekuuru could be. It could be a private booru. Well, you could subscribe to a list of boards and get a nice list of images from these. But to upload anything to them, or add comments, you'd have to register there for one. Via invite. Semi-private, but with a nice touch. Something to work with to learn some django.

"Dev" notes about future things. And stuff. List below.
- Tag changes: tags could be deleted from board. Tag administration will be set for board users with MOD or higher priviledge. For the sake of making it work, tags could be added and removed with a 'type one, we'll see if it goes' manner. MIGHT look after better solution if time will allow for that.
- As of tags... we'll probably let user make a full list of ignored tags. Or did it work another way? Have to double-check that. That's still a thing to think about. Probably with a nice cup of coffee. Sorry, tea.
- Maybe... we've overlooked that one? Or something else? But it would be nice if we would add a NSFW checkmark for a tag. User could just set option to cover/hide NSFW tags for one of her profiles with one single click. Ignore list could be auto-generated then.
- Stuff stuff stuff it's half past 11 pm leave me alone I want to sleep. This sentence shouldn't be in here, like, such sentences shouldn't be in any serious readme.
